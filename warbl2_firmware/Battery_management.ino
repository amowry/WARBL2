Notes:

The battery is a 400 mAH 2/3 AAA NiMH cell. Example brands are PKCell, Kastar, Dantona, and GP. Either flat top or button top works. The real-world capacity of these is usually around 350 mAH, and charging takes 3 hours.
The BQ25172 charger will charge safely without any of this code when enabled by driving the chargeEnable pin high. The code monitors the battery level and does a better job of charge termination (0 dV/dt algorithm) to prolong battery life.
The charger will only start charging if the battery voltage is below ~ 1.35V and the battery temperature is between ~ 0 and 40 degrees C.
Charging is set by resistors to ~110 mA (0.275 C) with a 4-hr safety timer. The charger will also terminate if battery voltage is > 1.7 V or battery temperature is over 40 degrees C.
Total device consumption is < 100 mA @ 5V, so any USB host (including iOS) will be able to charge.
The charger will report a fault (missing battery, out of temperature range) by blinking the STAT pin at 1 Hz.
