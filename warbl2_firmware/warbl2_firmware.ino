Approximate WARBL2 power budget (at 3.0 V): ~ 2.5 mA for NRF52840, 1.5 mA for ATmega32u4, 3.5 mA for tone hole sensors, 1.5 mA for other peripherals. 8.7 mA total, for ~ 12 hour battery life with 350 mAH battery and 86% efficient boost converter


***Notes about the FFC expansion port:
Connector is Molex 0512810598 (see datasheet for cable design): https://tools.molex.com/pdm_docs/sd/512810598_sd.pdf
An example of an off-the-shelf cable is GCT 05-05-A-0050-A-4-06-4-T.
Pinout from left to right, holding WARBL with mouthpiece pointing up, looking at the port: GND, D31, D5, 3V0, A0/D14. A0 can be used for reading an analog sensor, and any of the GPIO can be used at high speed for I2S, software I2C, etc. If reading a sensor, it's recommended to conserve battery life by using a digital pin to turn the sensor on only when needed.
